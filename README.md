Mapping Earthquakes
-------------------

For this project, I retrieved GeoJSON data from the USGS website related to earthquake activity over the past 7 days - this data was then overlayed onto an interactive map, using JavaScript and the D3 library, that displays all earthquakes, major earthquakes, and location of tectonic plates.
